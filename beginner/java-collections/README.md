# Java Collections

This folder contains Java programs that demonstrate the use of the Java Collections Framework for storing, managing, and manipulating groups of objects efficiently.

## Overview
The Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes that help in handling data dynamically, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.

This section focuses on understanding **what each collection is**, **when to use it**, and **how to use it correctly**.

## Topics Covered

### List
- [ ] ArrayList
- [ ] LinkedList
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Basic list operations (add, remove, get, set, size)

### Set
- [ ] HashSet
- [ ] LinkedHashSet
- [ ] TreeSet
- [ ] Handling duplicate elements

### Map
- [ ] HashMap
- [ ] LinkedHashMap
- [ ] TreeMap
- [ ] Key–value pair operations

### Queue and Deque
- [ ] PriorityQueue
- [ ] ArrayDeque
- [ ] FIFO and priority-based processing

### Iteration Techniques
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] ListIterator
- [ ] Enhanced for loop

### Supporting Concepts
- [ ] Generics (basic usage with collections)
- [ ] Collections utility class
- [ ] Comparable and Comparator (basic introduction)

## Goal
To build a strong understanding of Java’s collection classes and interfaces and to use the appropriate data structure for different problem scenarios.
